# Pollution Monitoring IoT Project

## Project Overview
The **Pollution Monitoring IoT Project** is a real-time air quality monitoring system built using ESP32 and Raspberry Pi. Environmental data is collected using sensors, transmitted wirelessly, stored in a database, analyzed using ThingSpeak and MATLAB, and based on pollution thresholds, an alert is triggered using LED actuation.

This project demonstrates an **end-to-end IoT pipeline** including sensing, communication, storage, cloud analytics, decision-making, and actuation.
