# Pollution-Monitoring-IoT-Project
IoT-based Pollution Monitoring System monitors air quality parameters using sensors connected to an ESP32. The data is transmitted to a Raspberry Pi, stored in a database, analyzed using ThingSpeak and MATLAB, and based on the analysis, real-time actuation is performed using an LED indicator when pollution levels exceed a defined threshold.
